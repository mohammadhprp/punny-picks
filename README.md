This project uses machine learning to classify bananas as good or bad quality.

### Requirements

* Python 3.x
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

**Installation:**

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

* **Python:** As the primary programming language.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and tools.

### Development

This repository includes code for:

* Data loading and pre-processing (replace with your data handling steps)
* Exploratory data analysis (using libraries like seaborn)
* Feature engineering (if applicable)
* Model training with various algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest)
* Hyperparameter tuning (using RandomizedSearchCV)
* Model evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, classification report, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve)
